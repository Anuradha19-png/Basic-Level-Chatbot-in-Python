Basic Level ChatBot

The main aim of our project is to make common peoples to interact with a computer system. So here we go with a chatbot which is a simple computer program that can communicate as human
A chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation, allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person. Chatbots can be as simple as rudimentary programs that answer a simple query with a single-line response, or as sophisticated as digital assistants that learn and evolve to deliver increasing levels of personalization as they gather and process information.
In our project “CHATBOT FOR “AS COMPLEX”” shows how a consumer can interact with a computer system as a human with each other. A consumer can interact with the chatbot.
A consumer can interact with a system so that he/she can receive the required information from the chatbot. The consumer comes to know about the availability of the required product. The location of the required product.
The questions and the answers were fed to the chatbot by the Admin. When the consumer asked the questions the chatbot provides the corresponding answers. With the help of the chatbot the customer comes to know what they need.  Hence, the chatbot help us to know about the status, location, cost etc.,  of the items at the shops. And these chatbots are will be very easy and simple to use.
